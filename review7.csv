I wish we'd never left this beautiful spot. Wendy's house was spectacular, we loved every minute there. We were a group of 12 people including an infant, and there was plenty of space for all of us. The views from the terrace were beautiful, short walk to the beach and the house was equipped with everything we could possibly need. Wendy was so responsive and gracious, we felt so spoiled. Thank you for everything Wendy, we hope to come back one day!
