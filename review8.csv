Our stay in this beautiful home was fantastic! The house is located in a prime location near some of the island's best beaches and other attractions including Queen's Bath, Hanalei, the Na Pali Coast, etc. Tammy is very kind and easy to work with and the home is clean and welcoming. Highly recommended
